{"name":"Brandon Anzaldi","tagline":"Code from coffee","body":"###About\r\n----------\r\nIf you're here from the internet, I'm most likely an enigma to you. If you found my [other website](http://brandonanzaldi.com) first, then I'm probably still an enigma, but you at least know what I look like. I code because I can. I'm sometimes paid for it, but more often than not, I do it because I want to, or I need something that doesn't exist. So feel free to peruse this site to your heart's content. \r\n\r\n###Projects\r\n----------\r\n[BrandonAnzaldi.com](https://github.com/caffeinewriter/BrandonAnzaldi.com) - My Poet powered weblog, with a few personal twists and turns.\r\n\r\n[CommonGd](http://github.com/caffeinewriter/CommonGd) - A charity site done in a weekend. No profit from this one. In production at [Common.gd](http://common.gd).\r\n\r\n[Last.fm Dynamic Image](http://github.brandonanzaldi.com/lastfm-dynamic-image) - A static image generator for Last.fm.\r\n\r\n[ajax-chat-plugins](https://github.com/caffeinewriter/ajax-chat-plugins) - Plugins for [AJAX Chat](https://frug.github.io/AJAX-Chat)\r\n\r\n[Podcaster.js](https://github.com/caffeinewriter/podcaster-js) - An iTunes compatible auto-generating podcast framework. \r\n\r\n[More Projects](https://github.com/caffeinewriter) - I have any number of unfinished projects and playgrounds at any time, so feel free to peruse my forks and the like projects that have accumulated on there.\r\n\r\n###Hacking\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI do consider myself a hacker. I have made a trip to DEFCON, and met people who have made me feel amazingly unintelligent in comparison, but in a very good way. I tinker and hack, and usually break something, but it's all for the best.\r\n\r\n###Hackathons\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nI personally have a love of Startup Weekends and Hackathons. They're insanely productive, and great networking events. If you see me at one, say hi.\r\n\r\n###More\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis will likely fill up with aphorisms, however, they will be sparse in comparison to my blog, where aphorisms fly as freely as dust in the wind.
